# kindle-cleanup-tool (windows bat script)

## How to use

1. Download ```sdr-clean.bat``` , and put it on your kindle's root directory, where you can see a ```documents``` directory besides it.
2. Run ```sdr-clean.bat``` and hit any key to remove all .sdr directories

**Note**

You'll lose all reading progress after doing so.

## Why

1. Tried some other tools, feels too heavy for this job.
